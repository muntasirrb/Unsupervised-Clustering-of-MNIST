This project presents an improved unsupervised
clustering method based on a deep autoencoder architecture
tailored for the MNIST dataset. The architecture leverages convolutional
and depthwise separable convolutional layers alongside
batch normalization to effectively capture compressed and
meaningful latent features from digit images. These features
are subsequently clustered using the KMeans algorithm. Model
performance is assessed using Adjusted Rand Index (ARI),
Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), and Silhouette Score.
The results demonstrate enhanced cluster consistency and better
inter-class distinction, highlighting the methodâ€™s potential for
scalable unsupervised learning in image-based tasks.
